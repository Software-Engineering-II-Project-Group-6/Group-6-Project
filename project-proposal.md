## MyHealthyBody: A Nutrition Planner Website
### Abstract
Our website allows users to create a free, detailed nutrition plan, either manually or with the help of AI. Each product includes detailed descriptions along with its macro values. User profiles can be customized, and various achievements can be unlocked by staying committed to their planner which will make their diet more fun. 

### Goal
Dieting can be challenging, and it's not easy for most people to give up their favorite foods or sweets. With this app, we aim to make the process easier by offering fun achievements and a user-friendly interface. Additionally, we provide specialized nutrition plans with a variety of options. 

### Current Practice
There are similar websites available in today’s market, but most require a monthly or yearly subscription. 

### Novelty
Unlike those, our service will be completely free. We also aim to make it more fun and engaging, like how Duolingo approaches language learning. The difference is that we focus on food and nutrition, and we do not have a bird threatening to take your family hostage if you miss a daily streak! 

### Effects
With this website, even if we manage to help just one person stay committed to their diet and achieve their goals, it will be a win for us. Making a difference in the world begins with small, simple steps. 

### Technical Approach
Our dynamic website will be developed using MongoDB, Node.js, and Mongoose. We also plan to utilize some free APIs available on GitHub for product information. 

### Risks
The riskiest part is depending on APIs for our products because depending on the APIs we choose; our product range can stay a bit limited. Although it won’t be a problem if we act early to find a solid API, it could be dangerous to wait until the last minute. We are going to mitigate this risk by acting and implementing this system earlier. 

## Implementations
### Major Features to Implement
1. Account creation with specialized goals
2. Product List and creating a personal nutrition list based on preferences
3. Filtering system based on allergies
4. Achievements 

### Stretch Goals
1. Nutrition themed games
2. Daily quests
3. AI Chatbot to help with dieting
4. Calorie/water tracker
