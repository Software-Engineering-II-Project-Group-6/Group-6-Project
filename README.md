# NourishQuest - A Nutrition Planner Website
Our website allows users to create a free, detailed nutrition plan, either manually or with the help of AI. Each product includes detailed descriptions along with its macro values, and filterable information such as allergens. User profiles can be customized, and various achievements can be unlocked by staying committed to their planner which will make their diet more fun!

# NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR/TA
Our repo is broken up into multiple branches:
- `main` for deployment, to be kept functional and ready to demo at all times
- `dev` for testing and development, where changes are Pull Requested to for individual in-progress features and bug-fixes
- `feature-*` these branches are for individual major features, and are where the majority of our team members' code contributions will be. They can be as broken as needed while developing a given feature without affecting full-app testing and the live deployment
