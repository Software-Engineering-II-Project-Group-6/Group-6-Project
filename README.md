# NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR/TA
Our repo is broken up into multiple branches:
- `main` for deployment, to be kept functional and ready to demo at all times
- `dev` for testing and development, where changes are Pull Requested to for individual in-progress features and bug-fixes
- `feature-*` these branches are for individual major features, and are where the majority of our team members' code contributions will be. They can be as broken as needed while developing a given feature without affecting full-app testing and the live deployment
