# Weekly Report - Week 4
## Team Report
During Week 4, we shifted our focus to finding the external API (Open Food Facts) and finalizing the database structure (MongoDB). We also established fundamental front-end and back-end functionalities, including user registration and login.
### Last Week's Goals
- Finalize the front-end layout and core website functionality.
- Integrate server-side components.
- Set up and configure the project database.

### Progress & Issues
- Progress: Introduced and tested the Open Food Facts API, adding our core data for future features. Successfully set up MongoDB, ensuring secure storage for user data using hashed passwords. The team produced foundational HTML and CSS pages (still to be refined—along) with a functional registration and login system.
- Issues: None reported.

### This Week's Goals
- Improve the website’s front-end design for a more intuitive user experience.
- Conduct thorough testing of the data flow among the API, database, and website.
- Outline additional features to be added after the core functionality is stable.
